## Category
IDE, development

## Description
NetBeans is both an IDE and a platform for development. NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Java, PHP, C, C++, HTML5,[4] and JavaScript. The NetBeans Platform is a framework for simplifying the development of Swing desktop applications. The NetBeans IDE bundle for Java SE contains what is needed to start developing NetBeans plugins and NetBeans Platform based applications; no additional SDK is required.

## Why it should be included to `Awesome macOS open source applications ` (optional)
NetBeans has been accepted by Apache as a top-level project. It has a stable and engaged development community who have been driving development of the application for many years. There is a supportive community for new and experienced users. All Apache NetBeans source code is freely available to build yourself, or you can download (unsupported) daily development builds.
